# E-Commerce-Application

# Ecommerce-Follow-Along Project

Ecommerce-Follow-Along is a comprehensive project designed to guide developers through the process of building an e-commerce application from scratch. This project will cover various aspects of web development, including front-end design, back-end integration, and database management, providing a hands-on learning experience.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In this session, we focused on the foundational elements of the Ecommerce-Follow-Along project. Key topics covered included:

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialized the GitHub repository.
- Set up the basic structure for the application.

### 2. Technology Stack
An overview of the technologies that will be utilized throughout the project:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- React

### 3. Version Control
- Introduction to Git and GitHub for version control.
- Emphasis on best practices for committing code and managing branches.

### 4. Development Environment
- Configuration of local development environments to ensure consistency across team members.

This milestone sets the stage for further development and deeper exploration of e-commerce functionalities in upcomingÂ sessions.


## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend
In this milestone, the foundational backend structure for the e-commerce application was successfully established. Key achievements include:

### Backend Folder Structure:
- Organized the project into clearly defined folders (config, controller, db, middleware, model, and utility) to ensure scalability and maintainability.
### Database Integration:
- Set up a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose, enabling seamless interaction with the database.
### Environment Configuration
- Implemented a .env file to securely manage sensitive data such as database credentials, ensuring better security practices.
### Middleware Implementation
- Created essential middleware for authentication, error handling, and asynchronous error management to streamline request processing and ensure robust error handling.
### Utility Functions 
-Added reusable utility components like a custom error handler to improve consistency and simplify debugging.
### Git Integration
- Configured version control with Git and included a .gitignore file to exclude sensitive files and unnecessary folders like node_modules.

This milestone sets up a solid backend foundation for further development, including API implementation, user authentication, and business logic handling. It ensures that the project is structured, secure, and ready for future expansion.
